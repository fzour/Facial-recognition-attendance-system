# Facial recognition attendance system

* Python
* Flask
* Facial recognition

  This project uses face recognition technology to register attendance efficiently. It was specifically created for our university, aiming to automate the attendance process during exams and classes.There are two types of users:an administrator, empowered to initiate the attendance system by activating the camera and accessing reports; and students, who gain access to a comprehensive record of all their attended exams or classes.
